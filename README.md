Open source mod anyone can contribute to! Code it and It's in!

==========================================================================================================================

Coding Guidelines : 

* Please keep all features sane :) Or not sane, that works too.
* Also, make sure to include configurability for any feeatures you add in
  There will be an inbuilt api to easily add this so dont worry
* Try to keep changes to the main classes minimal, if you can just call a method in your own class from the main class so   that it remains neat
* Keep code clean and readable, for your own good ;)
